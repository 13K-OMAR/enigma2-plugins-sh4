== E.I.B.ox setup how-to ==

* install and setup linknx server
  (cf. http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/linknx/)

either
 * install knxweb
 * create visualization using knxweb ajax frontend
 * save design as xml
or
 * create visualization layout xml by hand or modify sample design.xml

* add or adapt this line in the <config> section of design.xml:
	<settings host="yourlinknxhost" port="1028" refresh="0" debug="true"/>
  refresh time is in ms. intervals below 500 will disable auto refresh.
  it is recommended to disable refresh and enable debug during setup phase and then 
  enable autorefresh and disable debug for performance reasons during normal operation

* copy design.xml into plugin directory on your dreambox
   
* quantize your custom images (must be in PNG format)
	pngquant 256 inputfilename.png 
  (cf. http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/apps/pngquant.html)

* rename quantized images back to original names and copy them to the images subdirectory

* restart enigma2 and have fun testing

* usage is pretty much self-explanatory:
  navigate with up and down keys,
  switch or change values with OK or left and right keys
  thermostat values can directly be entered with number keys
  navigation order is defined by the order of control nodes in the design.xml

* please report bugs at http://www.dream-multimedia-tv.de/board/
